Game Playing Bots
One of the things I'm currently interested in is game playing bots. At the present moment my bots are all implemented using traditional AI approaches. Though in the future my plan is to using modern deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches as well.

Tic Tac Toe
All tic tac toe related code and bots is located in the src/tictactoe folder. There are currently five bots, ranked from worst to best:

random_bot.py - makes random moves
one_layer_bot.py - searches one move into the future, will always pick a winning move if one is available, otherwise plays randomly.
two_layer_bot.py - searches two moves into the future, picks a winning move or blocks an opponent from winning, otherwise plays randomly.
invincibot.py - uses minimax search to always choose the optimal move, never loses but slow.
ab_bot.py - uses alpha-beta pruning to speed up finding optimal move, improves search over invincibot.py by ~95%.
I've also written several blog posts explaining each of these bots in detail.
